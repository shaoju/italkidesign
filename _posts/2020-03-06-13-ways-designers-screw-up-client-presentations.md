>A good designer who can sell work is more valuable than a great designer who can't. <br>
>The hardest part of design is presenting work. I’ve seen people who did amazing work get up in front of a client and lay eggs. I’ve also seen people do alright work and wind clients around their little finger. Optimally, you want to do good work and present it well. But I’d rather have a good designer who can present well than a great designer who can’t. Work that can’t be sold is as useless as the designer who can’t sell it. Presenting is a core design skill. In this session we’ll go over the most common mistakes designers make when presenting their work, and how to avoid them.

### 1. Seeing the client as someone they have to please

happiness is a side-effect of good design, not a goal.

### 2. Not getting off your ass

### 3. Starting with an apology

### 4. Not setting the stage properly

### 5. Giving the real estate tour

### 6. Taking notes

### 7. Reading a script

### 8. Getting defensive

### 9. Mentioning typefaces

### 10. Talking about how hard you worked

### 11. Reacting to questions as change requests

### 12. Not guiding the feedback loop

### 13. Asking “Do you like it?”

Learn the client’s goddamn name.
